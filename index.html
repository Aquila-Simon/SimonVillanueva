                Hello World! My name is Simon Villanueva, I am a SAIT graduate with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering Technology with a Major in Design and Automation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently rediscovering my interest in programming, so I am diving into Python and Web Development. I am currently learning some Game Development and Web Development just as a hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have various skills that I am continually working on expanding everyday. As I learn more things, this website shall grow alongside those skills that I learn.

            <p>
                My name is Aquila-Simon Villanueva and I am a Mechanical Engineering Technology: Design and Automation Graduate from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently 23 years old as of creating this website.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently working as an Automation Technologist in Training. Focusing on Providing Support to Clients with regards to Networking and Troubleshooting Issues. As well as Providing Support with Programming and Human Interface Machines (HMI) for Clients.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am passionate about Learning about my surroundings and how everything works. I am always ready to take on Challenges that could help further my knowledge and skills, and I am always willing to learn more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I take a special interest with the technological world with regards to anything Mechanical and Programming related.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As of recently, I picked up coding again, I first discovered programming when I was in Junior High. I took a Game Programming class as an optional class just to fill my time table. Through this course I was able to learn about Scratch. Scratch introduced me to the basic concepts of programming and where my programming curiosity began.
            </p>
            <p>
                I kept going to that class all the way till Grade 9. Once I graduated, I continued my interest into the Computer Science option class in High School. In this course I learned some basic HTML Programming, this is where I created a basic website for showing some recipes that I personally like. I kept at it until the end of Grade 11 and around this time was when I started considering pursuing Computer Science as a Degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                This journey of programming ended in my Grade 12 year. During my grade 12 year, the pandemic happened and during this time I had experienced difficulty with my coding classes. I tried to reach out to my teacher but they were unhelpful. Due to this, I lost a lot of motivation to keep pursuing programming until I eventually dropped the class and took a different option class in Photography.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around this time, I started applying to get into my original plan of Post Secondary. I applied to become an Automotive Technician aka Mechanic. I got placed into a waitlist multiple times leading to me taking a year and a half gap year. I took this opportunity to work and try to save some money.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will skip a bit to 2022. A lot of things happened in my life during this year, I got promoted to Crew Trainer in my Food Service Job, I started dating my beautiful and loving girlfriend, and generally started being happier to go at my own pace. This is also the year where I decided to get serious about my future and go back to school for my own future and for my partner's future as well. During this time, I semi rediscovered my interest in programming and I decided to pursue a course that will mix my interest in mechanicals and my interest in programming. This is when I discovered the course that I eventually pursued and got a Diploma in, Mechanical Engineering Technology at SAIT.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skip to January 2023, my first semester started and I was barely into the courses but I was enjoying it. I did struggle a lot but it was all worth it in the end. I got to learn a lot of things that I was interested in which I was also able to use in my daily life. I was not able to learn programming fully until my 3rd semester when I pursued the Design and Automation stream. In this stream I got to learn about programming in a PLC to automate processes. Nothing much happened in my 3rd semester so we can skip to the 4th and last semester in my diploma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 4th semester was our Capstone semester, in this semester I was able to make really good friends as I spent almost everyday with these cool people. We worked on a Project designing and programming a small CNC to engrave dog tags that we gave away during our showcase. It was also through one of my friends that I was able to get a Job opportunty shortly before I graduated, I have been working at my current job since then and I am enjoying it as much as possible. Of course there is hardships that come with it but I prefer to take it as a challenge to improve and learn. Especially when I am working the On Call Shifts.

                I am proficient in Multiple Programming Languages within the context of PLC programming such as Ladder Logic, Structured Text, and Sequential Function Charts. Most of my experience is within the context of Studio 5000 and MicroLogix from Rockwell and TIA from Siemens. Along with this I am also proficient with creating HMIs within the Siemens Programming Software with the Advanced Panels and Unified Panels. As part of my job, I also learned some network troubleshooting which includes logging into Client networks to troubleshoot issues with Router communications or Switch communications using Wireshark or Putty to list some.
