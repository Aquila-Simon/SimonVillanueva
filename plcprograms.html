            <p>
                I am proficient in Multiple Programming Languages within the context of PLC programming such as Ladder Logic, Structured Text, and Sequential Function Charts. Most of my experience is within the context of Studio 5000 and MicroLogix from Rockwell and TIA from Siemens. Along with this I am also proficient with creating HMIs within the Siemens Programming Software with the Advanced Panels and Unified Panels. As part of my job, I also learned some network troubleshooting which includes logging into Client networks to troubleshoot issues with Router communications or Switch communications using Wireshark or Putty to list some.
