# 🧭 Simon.py Website Development Roadmap

A structured roadmap for building and polishing Simon’s personal website and portfolio — designed to blend professionalism, personality, and interactivity.

## 🩻 Phase 1: Core Structure & Foundation 
**Goal:** Build the bones of the site — clean, working pages with core navigation.

- [X] Create base HTML structure (Home, About, Projects, Resume, Contact)
- [X] Set up responsive layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- [X] Build navigation bar (sticky or collapsible)
- [ ] Add consistent header/footer components
- [X] Link all pages properly (no dead links)
- [ ] Optimize for mobile/tablet viewports
- [ ] Add meta tags and SEO basics (title, description, Open Graph preview)

## 🖼️ Phase 2: Visual Identity & Styling
**Goal:** Establish your unique brand look and feel.

- [ ] Apply main color scheme — #209635 (primary green), dark charcoal, and accent color (amber/cyan)
- [ ] Set global typography — *Exo 2* (headings) + *Inter* or *Roboto Mono* (body)
- [ ] Implement dark mode as default (optional light mode toggle)
- [ ] Create site favicon & logo (simple circuit-tech “S” or “Simon.py” mark)
- [ ] Add smooth section transitions and subtle hover animations
- [ ] Apply consistent button styles (rounded corners, glow hover)
- [ ] Add background pattern or animation (grid lines, soft light sweep)

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Content & Personality
**Goal:** Make every page feel like *you*, not a template.

- [ ] Write tagline and hero text for Home page  
  *“Hi, I’m Simon — Automation Technologist by trade, digital tinkerer by passion.”*
- [ ] Add About page with photo or avatar, timeline, and “Fun Bits” list  
  *(e.g. favorite language, setup, caffeine source)*
- [ ] Create engaging project descriptions with humor and authenticity  
  *(e.g. “Debugged at 2 a.m. with coffee and regret.”)*
- [ ] Include section: “What I’m Currently Building” — highlight *SyntaxFlapError*
- [ ] Write polished resume summary with skill highlights
- [ ] Add personal quote or mission statement (small footer Easter egg)

---

## 🧩 Phase 4: Projects & Interactivity
**Goal:** Make your work interactive and visually alive.

- [ ] Build project grid or card layout with hover reveals
- [ ] Tag system for project filtering (#Python #Automation #Games)
- [ ] Add image previews or animated thumbnails for each project
- [ ] Integrate links to GitHub repos or demo pages
- [ ] Optional: embed live mini-demos (for lightweight scripts or games)
- [ ] Add “Tools Used” badges (icons for Python, PLC, Pygame, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Functionality & Performance
**Goal:** Polish the user experience under the hood.

- [ ] Optimize image compression and loading times
- [ ] Lazy-load project previews
- [ ] Smooth scroll and anchor-based navigation
- [ ] Add contact form with validation
- [ ] Configure email handling (Formspree, Flask backend, etc.)
- [ ] Add analytics or site visit counter (optional)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing and bug fixes

---

## 🌈 Phase 6: Personal Touches & Easter Eggs
**Goal:** Bring in that *Simon.py* soul and “wow” factor.

- [ ] Implement hidden console Easter egg (`run simon.py` prompt)
- [ ] Add subtle hover sound effects (synth ping or click)
- [ ] Animated cursor trail matching theme colors
- [ ] Footer auto-updates with current year and time
- [ ] Fun 404 page (maybe “System Error: Simon not found”)
- [ ] Include small animations triggered by scroll or clicks (via Framer Motion / JS)
- [ ] Optional: “Play Mode” — toggles fun UI variant (pixel art or terminal skin)

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: Deployment & Maintenance
**Goal:** Get it online and keep it sharp.

- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel
- [ ] Connect custom domain (e.g., `simonpy.dev` or `simonexe.com`)
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Create `README.md` for repo with build/deploy steps
- [ ] Regularly update with new projects or blog posts
- [ ] Version tracking (commit messages like “Phase 3 – Added About page personality”)

**End Goal:** A personal website that feels equal parts *engineer, creator, and innovator* — the perfect digital home for Simon.py.
